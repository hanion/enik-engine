# Key Features
- **Native C++ Scripting**
  - Write game logic using C++ scripting for maximum performance and flexibility.

- **Dynamic Script Loading**
  - The engine automatically detects and reloads script module when you compile it.

- **Physics Engine**
  - In development, this engine provides 2D physics simulations.

- **Tracy Profiler**
  - Integrated Tracy profiler for profiling and optimizing performance.

# System Requirements

**Operating System**: üêß Linux

üì£ **Note**: 
I have a strong preference for developing on Linux and currently do not have a Windows development environment.
But I'm open to contributions and may consider adding Windows support in the future.
Adding Windows support should not be difficult, as I have intentionally avoided using extensive platform-specific code.
