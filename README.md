## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hanion/enik-engine.git
```
### Building with `build.sh`

Simple wrapper script for building and running.

```bash
./build.sh [clean] [config] [run] [target] [static]
```

Arguments:

* `clean`: Removes the build directory
* `config`: `debug`, `release`, or `min`
* `run`: Runs the executable after build
* `target`: Choose `editor` or `runtime`
* `static`: Statically link the script module

#### Example

```bash
./build.sh clean run
```


### Building with CMake (Manual)

```bash
cd enik-engine
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Exporting Projects

The `export.sh` script bundles a project and its assets for distribution.

```bash
./export.sh <platform> <project_title> <path_to_project>
```

Arguments:

* `<platform>`: linux | mingw | all
* `<project_title>`: name of the exported folder
* `<path_to_project>`: root path to your enik-engine project

#### Example

```bash
./export.sh linux snake-game /home/user/projects/snake-game
```

This will create an export at: `enik-engine/export/linux/snake-game`
